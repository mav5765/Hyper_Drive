### Instructions to play the game ###

Step 1: Install python using either the microsoft store or the python website.

Step 2: Install pygame using a terminal with this command, (pip install pygame) # Do not include the parentheses!

Step 3: After installing python and pygame you should be able to run the game using vscode or any other code editor that has python support. I recommend vscode!

Step 4: Make sure you click run on the main file named hyper_drive, the others won't run because they're supplementary files.

### Controls ###

Use the arrow keys to move left and right, spacebar to shoot, and Q to quit.
